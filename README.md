# Keras demonstration for Stockholm Machine Learning Club
This repo contains the code used for a demonstration of Keras for beginners. WORK IN PROGRESS!

If you want to follow along then you will need to complete several setup steps to be able to run the code in the Jupyter notebook (conda commands in brackets):

- First clone the repo and enter the root folder keras_demo
- Recommended: Create new environment and activate it (<code>conda create -n 'keras_demo'</code>; <code>conda activate 'keras_demo'</code>)
- Install python and packages per requirements.txt (<code>conda install --file requirements.txt</code>). Currently this is not working on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04), I'm working on it.

Then you should be able to run the jupyter notebook (type <code>jupyter notebook</code> to start the jupyter server (which will open a browser window), then open the file "Keras demo.ipynb"
