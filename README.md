# Keras demonstration for Stockholm Machine Learning Club
This repo contains the code used for a presentation giving a demonstration of Keras for beginners

Also required: Spam Assassin corpus available from https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments/tree/master/Exercise6 (download whole Data folder)

If you want to follow along then you will need to complete several setup steps to be able to run the code in the Jupyter notebook (conda commands in brackets):

- First clone the repo and enter the root folder keras_demo
- Recommended: Create new environment and activate it (<code>conda create -n 'keras_demo'</code>; <code>conda activate 'keras_demo'</code>)
- Install python and packages per requirements.txt (<code>conda install --file requirements.txt</code>)
- Install jupyter (<code>conda install jupyter</code>)
- Recommended: Install nb_conda (<code>conda install nb_conda</code>) to get Jupyter to use the new environment

Further instructions are in the Jupyter notebook.
