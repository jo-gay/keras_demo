# Keras demonstration for Stockholm Machine Learning Club
This repo contains the code used for a demonstration of Keras for beginners. WORK IN PROGRESS!

If you want to follow along then you will need to complete several setup steps to be able to run the code in the Jupyter notebook (conda commands in brackets):

- First clone the repo and enter the root folder keras_demo
- Recommended: Create clean python 3.6 environment and activate it (<code>conda create -n keras_demo python=3.6</code>; <code>conda activate keras_demo</code>)
- Install python and packages per requirements.txt (<code>conda install --file requirements.txt</code>). This will probably only work in Windows and with Conda. For other setups you can install, in this order, tensorflow, keras, pillow, matplotlib, jupyter, nb_conda. The latest version of keras seems to insist on installing theano, even though you already have tensorflow, which produces a ton of warnings in the shell. You can ignore these.

Then you should be able to run the jupyter notebook (type <code>jupyter notebook</code> to start the jupyter server (which will open a browser window), then open the file "Keras demo.ipynb"
